# Learning Log

A personal journal for tracking daily progress, technical discoveries, and incremental learning steps.

### Purpose
This repository serves as a record of small, frequent updates in my engineering journey. Rather than large dumps, I focus on consistent, daily reflections on topics like:
- **SQL & Databases**: Performance tuning, query patterns.
- **Python**: Deep dives into the ecosystem and best practices.
- **System Design**: Architectural patterns and trade-offs.

### Structure
- `logs/`: Monthly organized learning journals.
- `snippets/`: Focused code blocks and specific documentation reviews.

*Note: This log is automated for daily check-ins to maintain a consistent learning habit.*
